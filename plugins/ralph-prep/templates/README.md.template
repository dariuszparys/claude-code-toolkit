# ${TASK_NAME}

${TASK_DESCRIPTION}

## Quick Start

```bash
# Make the loop script executable
chmod +x ralph.sh

# Run the autonomous loop
./ralph.sh

# Or run with custom max iterations
MAX_ITERATIONS=20 ./ralph.sh
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ralph.sh` | Loop runner script - executes Claude Code iterations |
| `prompt.md` | AI prompt context - instructions for each iteration |
| `prd.json` | User stories - atomic tasks in dependency order |
| `progress.txt` | Progress tracking - current story and completed log |
| `AGENTS.md` | Agent instructions - gotchas, patterns, constraints |
| `README.md` | This file - usage guide |

## User Stories

**Total: ${STORY_COUNT} stories**

${STORY_LIST}

## Monitoring

```bash
# Watch the log file
tail -f ralph.log

# Check current progress
cat progress.txt

# See remaining stories
jq '[.userStories[] | select(.passes == false)] | length' prd.json
```

## Troubleshooting

### Loop stops unexpectedly
- Check `ralph.log` for errors
- Verify `progress.txt` has correct current story number
- Ensure `prd.json` acceptance criteria are achievable

### Story keeps failing
- Review the acceptance criteria in `prd.json`
- Check if the story is too large (should be 5-30 min of work)
- Look for missing dependencies or constraints

### Build failures
- Check that the build command is correct
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Review recent changes in git log

## Manual Intervention

If you need to fix something manually:

1. Stop the loop (Ctrl+C)
2. Make your fixes
3. Update `progress.txt` if needed
4. Restart: `./ralph.sh`

## Branch

All work is on branch: `${BRANCH_NAME}`

```bash
# Switch to this branch
git checkout ${BRANCH_NAME}

# See all commits
git log --oneline
```
