## Key Patterns from Codebase

${CODEBASE_PATTERNS}

## Your Workflow

Follow this exact workflow for each iteration:

### 1. Read Current State
- Read `progress.txt` to find the current story number
- Read `prd.json` to get the story details
- Find the first story where `passes: false`

### 2. Implement the Story
- Follow the story's description and acceptance criteria exactly
- Reference existing patterns in the codebase
- Make minimal, focused changes
- Don't modify unrelated code

### 3. Verify
- Run the verification command: `${BUILD_COMMAND}`
- All acceptance criteria must pass
- Build must succeed

### 4. Commit
- Stage your changes: `git add -A`
- Commit with message: `story ${STORY_ID}: ${STORY_TITLE}`
- Do NOT push (the loop handles that)

### 5. Update Progress
- In `prd.json`, set `passes: true` for the completed story
- In `progress.txt`, increment "Current story" and "Completed" counts
- Add a log entry with timestamp and story ID

### 6. Signal Completion
- If ALL stories now have `passes: true`, output: `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>`
- Otherwise, the loop will run another iteration for the next story

## Critical Rules

1. **One story per iteration** - Complete exactly one story, then stop
2. **Verify before committing** - Never commit broken code
3. **Update tracking files** - Always update prd.json and progress.txt
4. **Follow existing patterns** - Match the codebase style
5. **Respect constraints** - Never violate the listed constraints

## Files Reference

- `prd.json` - User stories and acceptance criteria
- `progress.txt` - Current iteration tracking
- `AGENTS.md` - Additional context and gotchas

## Stop Condition

When all stories have `passes: true` in prd.json, output this exact string:

```
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

This signals the loop to stop.
